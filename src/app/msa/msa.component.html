To the extent an Order Form provides for a  Subscription Term that automatically renews or provides Customer with pricing for Subscription Upgrades (as defined below), the Parties may confirm, thereby creating a binding obligation with respect to, such renewal or Subscription Upgrade via email without the need for an additional Order Form executed by the Parties.  </p>

        <p>(iii) <em>Platform Guidelines.</em> Customer hereby acknowledges that it will at all times comply with, and ensure that all of its Users and End-Users comply with, the platform guidelines set forth on Exhibit A, which are hereby incorporated by reference (the “Platform Guidelines”).</p>

Additional trial terms and conditions may appear on the Free Trial registration web page.

ANY CUSTOMER PROPERTY CUSTOMER SUBMITS TO THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES, AND ANY CONFIGURATIONS OR CUSTOMIZATIONS MADE TO THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES BY OR FOR CUSTOMER DURING THE FREE TRIAL WILL BE PERMANENTLY LOST UNLESS CUSTOMER PURCHASES THE SAME SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES AS COVERED BY THE FREE TRIAL OR CUSTOMER EXPORTS SUCH CUSTOMER PROPERTY BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL PERIOD.</p>

        <p>(b) Professional Services</p>

        <p>(i) <em>Scope. </em> Lylli LaunchTools will perform the Professional Services set forth in an Order Form executed by the Parties, which shall include and/or specify a description of the Professional Services to be provided to Customer and the applicable Fees and payment terms.

Payment obligations are non-cancellable and Fees paid are non-refundable, except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement.</p>

Credits can only be used by Customer and are non-transferable. To the extent that Customer has been awarded credits, unless the instrument (including any coupon) states an earlier expiration date, credits shall expire and no longer be redeemable twelve (12) months from the date the credit was issued.</p>

        <p>(c) <em>Acquired and Divested Businesses.  </em> If Customer has purchased Subscription Services under an Order Form for an unlimited number of Users within the Customer's enterprise, a particular business unit or division or otherwise (an “ELA”), any entity or business unit acquired by Customer after the applicable Order Form date (an “Acquired Business”), including its employees, shall not be entitled to any Subscription Services provided under such Order Form.

        <p>(d) <em>Entire Understanding. </em> This Agreement (including the DPA (if applicable) and all Exhibits and Order Forms, which are incorporated herein by reference) constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties as to its subject matter, and supersedes all prior proposals, marketing materials, negotiations and other written or oral communications between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

The arbitrator or a court of appropriate jurisdiction may issue a writ of execution to enforce the arbitrator's judgment.

        <p>(g) <em>Assignment.</em> Neither Party may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior express written consent of the other Party; provided, however, a Party may assign this Agreement in its entirety, together with all rights and obligations hereunder, without consent of the other Party, in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets related to this Agreement. Any attempt by a Party to assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement in breach of this section shall be void and of no effect. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties, their respective successors and permitted assigns.</p>

        <p>(h) <em>Notices. </em> Except for notification methods expressly permitted under the Platform Guidelines, all notices under this Agreement to Customer shall be in writing and shall be delivered to the addresses first set forth in the Order Form(s). Notices to Lylli LaunchTools shall be addressed to: Lylli LaunchTools, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 612 Howard St., 4th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105, with a copy to legal@Lylli LaunchTools.com.

Customer agrees to comply with all applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations and will not export or re-export any Controlled Technology in contravention to U.S. law, nor to any prohibited country, entity, or person for which an export license or other governmental approval is required. All Controlled Technology is generally prohibited for export or re-export to Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Sudan, and any other country subject to relevant trade sanctions. </p>

        <p>(l) <em>Severability. </em> If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as best to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect.</p>
